# Documentation

This folder contains the design documents used to create this application:

- [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](product_requirements_document.md): Defines the high level requirements and
  user stories that must be met for an MVP.
- [Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)](functional_requirements_specification.md): Builds on the PRD by
  producing actionable technical steps required to build the app. Where possible, PRs are linked to FRS sections.
- [Decision Logs](decision_logs): Decisions made during the FRS process are recorded in this folder, comparing
  various options for a particular decision.
